Maverick
Maverick is an app that can place bets automatically on hot51indo leveraging your existing web browser. It runs on Windows and macOS (Linux coming soon) and simulates human behaviour to avoid being detected. Bets are placed in an average of 5 seconds, making it ideal for live matches and real-time betting.

Maverick itself is just your executor arm for unattended betting. You can think of it as an API for hot51indo. Maverick does not include a betting strategy nor will perform any bets by itself. It's up to the user to send instructions to Maverick for them to be executed.

Instructions are sent via Websockets. The user is responsible for spinning up a Websocket server, through which it can send and receive commands from Maverick. An example server that is commonly used to start off can be found here. You can connect as many Maverick clients to your server as you want.

Basic programming knowledge is strongly recommended. This is not a plug-and-play solution.

How to use it?
Maverick is available upon request:

Email: abel (at) akila (dot) tech

What about other betting platforms?
Can it place bets on multiple platforms at the same time?
Yes indeed.
Can it use a Telegram group as feed for its tips?
Can I run it in my own computer at home or do I need a server?
I need XYZ, can you do it for me?

How to use
1. Configuration
Maverick expects to find a Config.toml file in the same directory as the executable. The file is pretty self-explanatory, but here's what to expect from every category:

Category	Description
Server	Connection URL to the WebSocket (RF6455) server that will send the commands to Maverick
Browser	Canonical path to the Chrome browser executable
Platforms	Betting platform credentials (in plain text) and additional features to be enabled
X	Developer credentials to post your bets on ùïè
Server settings
This is how the server settings should look:

[server]
addr = "ws://SERVER_HOST:PORT"
max_retries = 10
Property	Description
addr	The Websocket server address (incl. port)
max_retries	Max. n¬∫ of reconnection attempts before abort.
Browser settings
This is how the browser settings should look:

[browser]
bin_path = "/absolute/path/to/chrome"
window_size = [1500, 900]
Property	Description
bin_path	The absolute path of the Chrome binary.
window_size*	An array specifying window width and height.
window_pos*	(Optional) Window left and top offset coordinates.
*Window size and position settings may not as expected work on macOS.

Platform settings
This is how a platform configuration should look:

[platforms.https://hot51indo.com/]
host = "www.hot51indo.com"
username = "theBetGod"
password = "iLoveMe$$i!"
language = "en"
features = []
Property	Description
host	The root domain/host for the platform
username	The username of the account used to bet
password	The account password (in plain text)
language	The language of the account used to bet
features	Additional features to be enabled
2. Running Mavierick
Maverick is contained in a single binary and can be excuted using the command line.

Note: It is strongly recommended to run Maverick using a proper terminal/command line interface. Especially on Windows, the default console is known to cause issues when dealing with certain characters and colors.

macOS
$ ./maverick
Windows
maverick.exe
On startup, Maverick will automatically connect to the WebSocket server defined in the configuration file. On any disconnect, it will attempt to reconnect max_retries times. If a connection can't be established, Maverick will gracefully shut down.

3. Interfacing with Maverick
üí° We strongly encourage all new users to play around with the betreq CLI utility included in your Maverick bundle in order for you to understand how to specify your bets and get familiar with the API syntax.

On Windows: betreq.exe

On macOS/Linux: ./betreq

Maverick supports 3 commands from the upstream:

Command	Description
session_start	Starts a new session.
place_bet	Attempts to place a bet
close_bet	Attempts to close an open/active bet
Session Start
session_start will effectively start a new session. This means:

Dump full bet history for current session into a session log file.
Clear bet history and start a new, fresh betting session.
Reset equity for this session with current account balance.
Example:
"session_start"
Place Bet
place_bet will attempt to place a bet in the given match. place_bet contains a BetRequest object, for which the main parameters are:

id: A UUID that will uniquely identify this bet request on your system.
host: The root domain for the betting platform (platform host value from Config.toml)
bet: The bet(s) to be placed, which contains:
match: The details to identify the live match (see below for more details).
market: The actual market and participant we're betting on (see below for more details).
odds: The minimum odds we are looking for to place the bet.
tf: The time frame for the bet (e.g. FirstHalf, SecondHalf, FullTime).
stake: The amount of capital to be deployed on this bet.
Identifying a match
There's currently two ways of specifying a match:

Using the platform url:
"match": "https://hot51indo.com/#/IP/EV00000012345678"
Using the team names:
"match": ["Roma", "Lazio"]
Note: Combined bets only support url-identified matches.

Catching fast-changing handicaps
You can specify a tolerance factor for fast-changing handicaps. In the following example, all line values have a ¬±0.25 tolerance factor, which you can adapt to your needs.

"line":[[3.5],0.25]
"line":[[0.0, 0.5],0.25]
Score
Score is always a 2-element array, where the first element is the home team score and the second is the away team score.

"bet": {
  "market": {
    "score": [3, 4]
  },
  "match": "https://hot51indo.com/#/IP/EV00000012345678",
  "odds": 11.5,
  "tf": "FirstHalf"
}
Full Example: A complete multi-legged bet request
{
  "place_bet": {
    "bet": [
      {
        "market": {
          "result": "Leicester City"
        },
        "match": "https://hot51indo.com/#/IP/EV00000012345678",
        "odds": 15.3,
        "tf": "FullTime"
      },
      {
        "market": {
          "goals": {
            "over": 3.0
          }
        },
        "match": "https://hot51indo.com/#/IP/EV00000012345678",
        "odds": 4.1,
        "tf": "FirstHalf"
      },
      {
        "market": {
          "score": [2, 1]
        },
        "match": "https://hot51indo.com/#/IP/EV00000012345678",
        "odds": 3.85,
        "tf": "FullTime"
      }
    ],
    "host": "hot51indo.com",
    "id": "7e81d4da-3440-44d8-ad29-edc84fb73157",
    "stake": 25
  }
}
Odds
The minimum odds required to place the bet are set in odds. If the platform offers anything above, the bet will be placed.

Stake
The nominal cash amount to use for the bet, in the account currency.

CloseBet
CloseBet will attempt to close an open/active bet. The request is pretty straightfoward:

bet_req_id corresponds to the original bet request id used in PlaceBet when the bet was placed.
min_cashout is the minimum percent cashout value relative to the wager placed for Maverick to close the bet.
Example:
{
  "close_bet": {
    "bet_req_id": "7e81d4da-3440-44d8-ad29-edc84fb73157",
    "min_cashout": 1.6
  }
}
Maverick responses
Occasionally, Maverick will send data back to the Websocket server. These are the messages that can be expected.

Session started
Every time a new platform is logged in, a SessionData message will be sent back to the server containing:

Starting time of the current session
Starting balance of all currently logged in platforms
Here's an example:

{
  "date":1702985129669,
  "start_balance":{
    "hot51indo.com": 995.24,
    "bwin.es": 52.98
  }
}
Bet Reports
When either a PlaceBet or CloseBet is completed, Maverick will always send a full BetRequest object back to the server with all the details and history of everything that happened during that request, including (if applies) the close.

Here's a complete example of what it might look like:
